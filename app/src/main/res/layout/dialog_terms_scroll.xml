            android:text="1. LOAN AGREEMENT\n\nBy submitting this application, you ('the Borrower') agree to the terms and conditions set forth by BDO Unibank ('the Bank'). Use of the loan proceeds implies full acceptance of these terms.\n\n2. INTEREST RATES AND CHARGES\n\nThe interest rate applied is subject to change based on market conditions, the Borrower's creditworthiness, and the Bank's prevailing rates at the time of approval. The Bank reserves the right to adjust rates with prior notice. Additional fees, including processing fees and documentary stamp taxes, may apply.\n\n3. REPAYMENT TERMS\n\nYou agree to repay the principal loan amount plus all applicable interest and charges in monthly installments as specified in the Amortization Schedule. Payments shall be made via auto-debit arrangement (ADA) or other channels approved by the Bank. Late payments will incur a penalty charge of 5% of the due amount per month of delay.\n\n4. DEFAULT AND REMEDIES\n\nThe Borrower shall be considered in default if: (a) payment is not received on the due date; (b) any information provided in the application is found to be false; or (c) the Borrower violates any term of this agreement. Upon default, the Bank may declare the entire outstanding balance immediately due and demandable, and may pursue legal action to recover the debt.\n\n5. PRE-TERMINATION\n\nThe Borrower may pre-terminate the loan subject to a pre-termination processing fee calculated based on the outstanding principal balance and the unexpired term of the loan.\n\n6. DATA PRIVACY AND CONSENT\n\nYour personal data will be processed in accordance with the Data Privacy Act of 2012. You authorize the Bank to collect, process, and share your information with credit bureaus, government agencies, and third-party service providers for credit evaluation, risk management, and regulatory compliance purposes.\n\n7.

Any legal action arising from this agreement shall be brought exclusively in the courts of Makati City or the place of execution, at the sole option of the Bank.\n\n8.
